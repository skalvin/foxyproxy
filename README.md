* Escape button works to close the current FoxyProxy window and return to the previous (if there is a previous).
* Dialog box color changes for consistency
* Import optimizations and increase on import file size from 5 MB to 10 MB
* Show help text if no proxy settings are defined; hide all proxy selectors too including 'turn off'.
* Fixes so that FoxyProxy Basic can share the same codebase as FoxyProxy Standard again. Version number alignment: for the first time since FoxyProxy Basic
was introduced, it will share the same version number as FoxyProxy Standard.
* Exported settings now include FoxyProxy edition -- Standard or Basic. However, they are interchangeable. This is for easier debugging of problems.
* Removed link to https://forums.getfoxyproxy.org. We are shutting the forums down. People just don't use forums anymore; we only get spam there. And have many other support channels: email, ticket system, github, facebook, twitter, chat, etc.
